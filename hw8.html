                    <li>Make sure you include a hyperlink so the user can go back to the main page of the course - Homework 1.</li>
                    <li>Open the .xml file in your web editor, follows structure, include information for a new CD with your name as the ARTIST and YEAR.</li>
                    <li>Upload both files to server and open the HTML page on the browser.</li>
                    <li>Click on the button that shows in the browser and make sure to see a table with all the CDs listed in the XML file, including the new one with your name and the year.</li>
                    <li>Create a subheading with "Explanation of AJAX".</li>
                    <li>Below heading, explain what is happening with the JavaScript, AJAX code you see in the .html file.</li>
                    <li>Below the paragraphs of your explanation, create another header with REST API.</li>
                    <li>Below that heading, write about a chosen REST API from the List of API's.</li>
                    <li>The paragraphs will be a REPORT about the API you chose.</li>
                    <li>The report will be read by a group of developers that you would like to convince to use the API.</li> 
                    <li>You can even create a name of a company that you and the other developers would be working for and why the web application should be using the API you chose to explain.</li>
                    <li>In that report, you will include information about the following:<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of response file you get (JSON, XML, etc.)?<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you need any type of key to access and use the API?<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the companies need to pay any fee to use the API and if they need, how is that charged?<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need also to provide a link to any type of documentation that would help the developer use the API.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not use the URL as the words for the hyperlink, use meaningful words to make your hyperlink accessible for users using screen readers!</li>
                </ul>
